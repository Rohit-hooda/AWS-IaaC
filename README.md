# Terraform VPC Infrastructure

This Terraform code creates multiple Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) in a single region, each with 3 public subnets and 3 private subnets spread across different availability zones. It also creates an Internet Gateway and attaches it to the VPC, creates public and private route tables, and associates the subnets with their respective route tables.
